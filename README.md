##Overview

This scrpit and html produce a webpage with a data set that filters automatically based on changes in the search bars for 
date, city, state, country, and shape.

##Filtering the table

-Load the webpage


-Type a date, city, state code, or country code into the "filter search" boxes. Afterwards hit enter or just click off of the box.



-If you want to search more than one criteria just repeat the previous step.



-If your entry doesn't appear in the data set a blank table will be returned.


##Summary

###Drawbacks

The biggest drawback of the webpage is that these queries rely somewhat on a user knowing what values are in the dataset already.
For example, some of the shapes are "light" and "teardrop" a new user likely wouldn't know that these are options to search.

###Recommendations

I would recommend developing drop-down menus for each of the values besides date, while still being able to type into the bar for a search.
List the available shapes, state codes, country codes, and perhaps make the city menu update for whatever state you've searched as well.
